    "The objective of this assignment is to develop a Semantic Classification model. You will be using Word2Vec method to extract the semantic relations from the text and develop a basic understanding of how to train supervised models to categorise text based on its meaning, rather than just syntax. You will explore how this technique is used in situations where understanding textual meaning plays a critical role in making accurate and efficient decisions.\n"

With the massive volume of news articles published daily, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between credible and misleading information. This creates a need for systems that can automatically classify news articles as true or fake, helping to reduce misinformation and protect public trust.\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬† Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.  ¬†¬†¬† Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.     \n",

Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants.

       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬† Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.  ¬†¬†¬† Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.     \n",

Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬† Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.  ¬†¬†¬† Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.     \n",

Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.   \n",
       "1  South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.   \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.   \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.   \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).

       "      <td>In Republican state, Obama talks with worried American mom OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. to expand refugee program for Central Americans fleeing violence WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bid to mine more coal on U.S. federal lands tests Obama's green agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said.

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

by mavericks donald trump and ted cruz regarded as wellspoken and telegenic rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in iowa and new hampshire the

as well as antiestablishment conservatives who favor cruz the debate on the fox business network is due to begin at pm et on thursday gmt on friday the son of cuban immigrants rubio has drawn support by stressing his workingclass upbringing in las vegas and miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier but voters and party operatives suggest he has until

months to stick to wellhoned talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at townhall meetings where people can ask questions this has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience

rival candidates for the republican nomination have assailed rubio also for his absences from the us senate during hearings and floor votes raising further questions about how he spends his time defending his record of missed votes rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his senate committee work both of which he says continue unabated rubio aides told reuters they plan a multimilliondollar advertising campaign for new hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the tv airwaves in the state the aides said rubio has plans to be a major presence in both iowa and new hampshire in the final stretch with a schedule that will include plenty of giveandtake with voters in informal settings such as town halls they said rubio‚äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals but that much of it has been at behindthescenes fundraising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push republican strategists say rubio‚äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a thirdplace finish in iowa presumably behind poll leaders cruz and trump which would deliver him some momentum going into new hampshire if rubio goes on to place high in iowa and do well in new hampshire he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that

drawing increasingly larger crowds in new hampshire and has a solid organization in the state ‚äúi think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as

       "      <td>In Republican state, Obama talks with worried American mom OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. to expand refugee program for Central Americans fleeing violence WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bid to mine more coal on U.S. federal lands tests Obama's green agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

by mavericks donald trump and ted cruz regarded as wellspoken and telegenic rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in iowa and new hampshire the

faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the nov election made up of candidates dominated by the billionaire trump and us senator cruz of texas his prospects reach a critical moment at a thursday night debate in south carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to trump and cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former florida governor jeb bush and governors chris christie of new jersey and john kasich of ohio republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes trying to win over establishment republicans as well as antiestablishment conservatives who favor cruz the debate on the fox business network is due to begin at pm et on thursday gmt on friday the son of cuban immigrants rubio has drawn support by stressing his workingclass upbringing in las vegas and miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier but voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate facetoface politicking considered mandatory by voters in either iowa or new hampshire which has a feb primary rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the

months to stick to wellhoned talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at townhall meetings where people can ask questions this has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience ‚äúthere‚äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be but in iowa it just seems like he hasn‚äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚äôs

the florida house of representatives thorell said rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a republican administration ‚äúhe hasn‚äôt had any experience running anything‚äù thorell said while listening to rubio in concord new hampshire last week ‚äúhe did very well in the legislature down in florida and was mentored by jeb bush but he hasn‚äôt run anything‚äù rival candidates for the republican nomination have assailed rubio also for his absences from the us senate during hearings and floor votes raising further questions about how he spends his time defending his record of missed votes rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his senate committee work both of which he says continue unabated rubio aides told reuters they plan a multimilliondollar advertising campaign for new hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the tv airwaves in the state the aides said rubio has plans to be a major presence in both iowa and new hampshire in the final stretch with a schedule that will include plenty of giveandtake with voters in informal settings such as town halls they said rubio‚äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals but that much of it has been at behindthescenes fundraising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push republican strategists say rubio‚äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a thirdplace finish in iowa presumably behind poll leaders cruz and trump which would deliver him some momentum going into new hampshire if rubio goes on to place high in iowa and do well in new hampshire he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race ‚äúfrom the getgo we said we didn‚äôt want to peak in september we wanted to peak in february it‚äôs starting to grow it feels like it‚äôs starting to happen for us‚äù rubio spokesman alex conant said republican analysts say rubio appears to be as wellplaced as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment republican favorite he is drawing increasingly larger crowds in new hampshire and has a solid organization in the state ‚äúi think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as

       "      <td>In Republican state, Obama talks with worried American mom OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bid to mine more coal on U.S. federal lands tests Obama's green agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.  Today US capitalism makes its money by selling out the American economy and the people dependent upon it.In  freedom and democracy  America, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the American people. The sellout of the American people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.When America fails, so will Washington s vassal states in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.  Unless Washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute West will be an insignificant part of the new world.Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal.

United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

Treated US Sailors Well 21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

Yahoo Settles E-mail Privacy Class-action: $4M for Lawyers, $0 for Users 21st Century Wire says It s a familiar theme. Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013, Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users, who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week, they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal, the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment, Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF), Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox.

After all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own Arab army in Syria, they want to give it another try.This week, Pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside Syria (and to hell with international law).We re told that this was requested by Ankara, and with all NATO allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing Turkey s porous border with Syria, or so the story goes. Washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-Paris theme: to protect civilized Europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the Wall Street Journal: The program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between Washington and Ankara over sealing the border, which Western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave Syria and travel internationally, The timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely ISIS  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in Turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 German tourists, feeding perfectly into Europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. Shades of GLADIO, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).Our friends at Nation Builders Inc are banking on the global public suffering from Syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. The west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold Despite all of US-led Coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on Syria persists. It s on our TV screens and in our newspapers constantly   from Los Angeles to London, from Paris to Riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with Syria?  Everyone, except the Syria people  themselves, who like the people of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. As is tradition in Washington, London and Paris, the only Syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the Saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the Syrian National Council. Currently, that could be Riad Hijab,  George Sabra or Khaled Khoja. Next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with Washington or Riyadh.To anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  Syrian Opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  Four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is US-led Coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. Others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the Wahabist-Salafist terrorist brigades like al Nusra Front and Islamic State, or is it the West and its GCC partners?The unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. The West and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.Plans A-ZThe terrorist enclave in Syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of Iraq and Syria.Since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in Syria, starting with Plan A: the Arab Spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on Twitter) to demand  change . Their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the US State Department, along with its functionaries at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International America, and other Open Society Institute-funded NGOs and  human rights  organizations. Obviously, this did not work. Next, Plan B: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. The US and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. The west set up its own parallel government for Syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the Syria people. Then came Plan C: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. This fed into an already established  War on Terror  western narrative. Now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. The Washington-London-Paris-Tel-Aviv-Riyadh-Doha-Ankara Axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of Bashar al Assad in Damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. Who could blame them? After all, it worked in Libya in late 2011.Fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow Assad and implode the nation-state of Syria, the men and women of Nation Builders Inc and their muscles in Brussels (NATO), are quickly moving to Plan D: take territory. That s not to say plans A through D weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.We now know from Wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. Taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a Euro-centric empire in the Middle East, one could say the process began the day the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed in 1916. Concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. If those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. Whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially Syria. Proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.Mice and Men21WIRE was one of the first news sources to warn about Washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  No Fly Zone  in Northern Syria. It was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with ISIS being the object of the public s reaction. That plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the UN General Assembly in New York City. Later that week, Russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its Air Force, into the Syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a US-Turkey (NATO) controlled No Fly Zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. Suffice to say, that Russia already knew NATO s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.When asked two days ago about the prospect of the Washington DC latest brainchild, Train and Equip 2.0, this time inside Syria, here were my initial thoughts: We now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.As any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. The Truth About  Train and Equip The previous  train and equip  program ended with Washington s military brass paraded in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the US taxpayer to get er done. When originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the US government, in conjunction with the CIA, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in Turkey, Jordan or at a base in Saudi Arabia   before sending them to fight inside Syria. Washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight ISIS, and not the Syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for ISIS.Nine months into the train and equip project, US Army Gen. Lloyd Austin III, acknowledged in Sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. Not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the Obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for US  boots on the ground  in Syria. Doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. For the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  This is the media s natural default position. In other words,  Well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. Nothing to see here, move along.  To ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. Not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?The real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in Syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the US media to stomach   that the US  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. It wasn t a failure like fall guy Gen. Lloyd Austin will have you believe, it was a success.Judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al Qaeda in Syria (al Nusra Front), ISIS, Jaysh al Islam and others   it s clear that Uncle Sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in Syria.Middle East commentator and analyst Sharmine Narwani explains the West s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in Syria: For years, Washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in Syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  Why? Because if moderates were named and identified, the US would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. And the US could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in Syria over the past five years. The next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  The map above is from July 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in Syria.Safe Zone =  Sunnistan Somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the KLA in Kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in Bosnia, and NATO lording over a newly balkanized region.When you hear US officials like John McCain or clueless Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina, all crowing for a  Safe Zone  in northern Syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). Their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where ISIS is currently holding court. It s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  Syrians fleeing the evil Bashar al Assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto Sunni state-lette in waiting.So the US-led Coalition s  safe zone  is the very Caliphate that Americans are decrying.For anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in Syria, they need look no further than a set of US airstrikes that took place before Christmas. On December 6, 2015,  US fighter bombers struck a Syrian military base located in the village of Ayyash in Deir Ezzor Province, east of Raqqa, which killed 3 Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldiers and wounded additional others. Naturally, the Pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. What happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst Mike Whitney from Counterpunch Magazine: It s also worth noting, that according to South Front military analysis, the US bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale ISIS offensive on the villages of Ayyash and Bgelia.  In other words, the US attack provided sufficient air-cover for ISIS terrorists to carry out their ground operations. Was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? So the US air force was coordinating with ISIS boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. But it didn t end there. Less than 24 hours after the attack, US warplanes bombed the village of Al-Khan in north-eastern Syria killing 26 Syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. The message the US military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east Syria where it plans to remove ISIS and establish a de facto Sunni state consistent with its scheme to break Syria and Iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, Islamic fanatics, and US puppets. Also taking place at the same moment on Dec 6th, was Turkey s quiet little invasion into northern Iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of Mosul, right between the Kurds and ISIS. It should be noted that this illegal incursion by NATO member Turkey was not approved by the Iraqi government in Baghdad, and Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi called for Turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  Judging by Washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the US gave Turkey its full blessing. Here, Zero Hedge astutely points out the obvious: Most importantly of all, right on what Al-Araby al-Jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal ISIS crude into Turkey from Iraq.  Not surprisingly, Turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that Russia began to publicly expose Turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the ISIS oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy ISIS oil convoys moving from Syria into Turkey. And then Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen ISIS oil makes its way from Iraq into Turkey? Hardly a coincidence.Make no mistake, both ends of NATO s military axle, the United States and Turkey, along with their Saudi-backed boots on the ground in ISIS and al Nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. Once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in Europe, or in America   to allow the Axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a Kurdish canton, or a Sunni state-lette. Such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.To be perfectly clear, the terms  Sunni  and  Shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by Nation Builders Inc and its international partners in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. My intention here is not to reduce the Muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized Muslims for their own selfish ends.What s the  safe zone  for? As the US-led Coalition steps up its 18 month-long Punch  n Judy air operation to supplant ISIS from Raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their Turkish supply lines. Washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the Syrian government from towns like Homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the Assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. Once the NATO-GCC Axis has established a mini protectorate inside of Syria, this will provide everything ISIS, al Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside Syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in Syria   and beyond.This little Sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in Syria s northwestern Idlib governorate (province). Syria s border with Turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow Turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with Syria.If  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to NATO member Turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al Qaeda and ISIS, then Washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. If they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a No-Fly Zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy Damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up Syria and northern Iraq accordingly. ISIS RAT-LINES: Black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in Syria, and Iraq.For the architects of instability in Washington, one crucial benefit of carving out Sunni territory in both northern and eastern Syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. To guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of Syria and into Turkey and via Kurdistan, help is required from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and other stakeholders, including the British-Turkish firm Genel Energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit ISIS oil. Ditto for a key mover and shaker in Raqqa s new Rockefeller class, Bilal Erdogan, the son of Turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.This is a problem, but one which Washington, London and Paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. Iraqi, Kurdish and Turkish opposition officials have accused Turkish governments and the KRG of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.Even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that Greater Kurdistan will ever see the light of day if Nation Builders Inc having anything to say bout it. The promise of Greater Kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a Greater Kurdistan. Turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a Greater Kurdistan is not compatible with them. Iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. So they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-Kurdish entities sprout up around the KRG. Turkey has its own ongoing  Kurdish problem  within Turkish borders, so Ankara will naturally view any expressions of Kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international Kurdish solidarity. Ruling over the Kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.There are those within the Turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming Turk territory in both Syria and Iraq.SEE ALSO: SPECIAL REPORT: ISIS Oil? Follow the Money (Back to Europe)Here is where Sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in Iraq and across Kurdistan, as Mike Whitney explained: So it looks like an agreement has been struck between Turkey, the KRG and the United States to seize parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria to create a de facto Sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by Ankara and Washington.  It also looks like Obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka Terrorists) to work alongside US Special Forces to carry out future military operations.  So while the effort to remove Assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy Syria is as strong as ever.  Another dismembered part of old Syria and Iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called Rojava (see map above), or  Western Kurdistan . This region in northern Syria, formerly known as Syrian Kurdistan, gained its autonomy in November 2013 as part of the ongoing Rojava Revolution. The Kurdish defense forces here are known as the YPG (People s Defense Units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring Turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because YPG defense forces present resistance to both al Nusra and ISIS encroachments into all three Rojava cantons. For Turkey, this is bad for business. How Rojava will factor into Washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.Make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. Do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the UN, or the fair weather international community.Another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and Israel too, was PNAC walrus and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the New York Times, where he states: Today s reality is that Iraq and Syria as we have known them are gone. The Islamic State has carved out a new entity from the post-Ottoman Empire settlement, mobilizing Sunni opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-dominated government of Iraq. Also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent Kurdistan. Central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of Sunni vs Shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Bolton confirms this: If, in this context, defeating the Islamic State means restoring to power Mr. Assad in Syria and Iran s puppets in Iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state. Not so fast Mr. Ambassador. The Islamic State is the Sunni State.So for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the Caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). This is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to Azerbaijan and into Iran, and later towards the Eurasian heartland of Dagestan (Russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).In the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming Bashar al Assad for the suffering of his people. It s already wearing thin.Until the US and its NATO-GCC Axis stops flooding Syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.If the Syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***Author Patrick Henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international TV and radio.

Jazeera America will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in broadcast media history.Ever since the US and its allies began plotting to overthrow Libya and Syria, Al Jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in 2003   into what it has become in 2016   a full-blown agit prop media shop for the US State Department and the Pentagon. In fact, US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha, conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it. I know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job,  reads a company email from CEO Al Anstey, obtained by Politico.Indeed, they tried everything it seems, just short of paying Americans to watch their programs Al Jazeera America to close down https://t.co/EmFjBw9uC1 pic.twitter.com/HDea8ujTPt  Al Jazeera America (@ajam) January 13, 2016In 2012, the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera purchased Current TV from Al Gore for an inflated $500 million. Wait, it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon, Current TV, the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy, did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex, AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side, the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch   \n",

Neocon Political Stunt 21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.Today, Iranian military forces report that two small riverine U.S. Navy boats were seized in Iranian waters, and are currently being held on Iran s Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. A total of 10 U.S. Navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by Iranian authorities. NAVY STRAYED: U.S. Navy patrol boat in the Persian Gulf (Image Source: USNI)According to the Pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: The sailors were on a training mission around noon ET when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into Iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the Iranian Coast Guard, officials added. The story has since been slightly revised by White House spokesman Josh Earnest to follow this narrative:The 2 boats were traveling en route from Kuwait to Bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the Iranians.According to USNI, search and rescue teams from the Harry S. Truman Strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the Iranians. We have been in contact with Iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told AP. According to Persian Gulf TV: Farsi Island is one of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, Bushehr province of Iran. There is an IRGC Navy base on this Island. The island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. According to NBC News, U.S. State Department is in touch with Tehran officials and the Iranians recognize that the U.S. Navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  WAR INC: CNN s Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with Israeli-financed neocon Senator Tom Cotton.Neocon StuntAlready, the U.S. media, including CNN and FOX, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for President Obama right before tonight s State Of Union speech, when he s trying to prove to the American people that Iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. This latest Naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the Iran Nuclear Deal. To say this is a coincidence might be naive.That said, could GOP and Israel-aligned members of the Pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken U.S.-Iran relations, and by extension, Obama s controversial Iranian Nuclear Deal?This looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the Israel Lobby-sponsored, pro-war U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R), placed by CNN to direct aggressive U.S. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. Cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed Iran for the U.S. boat drifting into Iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on President Obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the Iranian aggression. Cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, CNN s Wolf Blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge Cotton s imaginary statement: The Iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (American) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cotton then went on to threaten Iran, saying that: These sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. If they are not released, then the Iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  Cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to Iran, saying that,  All (military) options should be on the table.  Would Washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that Iran would not harm U.S. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? The answer is  yes , and they ve done it before In 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which just happened to take place during a US presidential election cycle, with then president Jimmy Carter (D) running for reelection against challenger Ronald Reagan (R). The crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against Carter in the media. According to reports at the time Reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new Iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. In the end, Reagan won and took credit for that  victory .Not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged CNN segment, Cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of Jimmy Carter which  caused  the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, and compared that to President Obama s current policy.Of all the U.S. Officials CNN could have brought in on  short notice , they chose Senator Tom Cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to Israel. Clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.Stay tuned for more updates.READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran Files   \n",

hashtag hell the fake left by dady chery and gilbert mercierall writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractionsmore and more for us such thoughts are occasioned not by the mainstream which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy but by the fake left which lobotomizes most of whom it touches the increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left and it is making great strides in this regardthe real left includes those who like dr martin luther king jr mlk came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed rather than tiny incremental change the real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority it is not for rent or for sale and it does not cave in to power martin luther king march image source wikicommonsby contrast the motivations of the fake left are money and fame the preservation of their place in their ivory towers together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle for them the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals speaking tours radio and television interviews and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the internet their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities paralysis and futile actions they attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attentiondeficit disorder ideas are not pursued shared honed and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like hope and change or feel the bern alternatively the ideas are muddled branded and labeled with names like shock doctrine disaster capitalism or climate capitalism so that they may be put away and no longer examined an important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate spontaneous defense righteous anger is made to give way to confusion and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent thoughts not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions like blockage of bridges and highways quickly dissipate they are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words like black lives matter and then shared on social media today thomas paine s common sense would not kindle a revolution instead it would be quoted posted pinned and tweeted the fake left is a decoy a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution one of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire george soros who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and nongovernmental organizations ngo in more than countries artists throughout the world who present their people as victims and promote passivity and despair are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes supported organizations like human rights watch and amnesty international are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights independent journalism is a major focus of soros open society foundation which was founded in soon after the collapse of the soviet union and right before the explosion of the internet when usfriendly corrupt governments and ussponsored institutions like usaid and the united nations are exposed by the real left sorossponsored think tanks and news organizations like the center for economic and policy research cepr spring into action and become the voice of reason demanding that these organizations selfreform countless others also related to the open society foundation echo and amplify their message dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda in most of the world and especially the us elections are staged with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population a secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas the candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people in the us in the mean misogynist and racist ugly american stereotype is served well by donald trump for the right on the other side the reincarnated occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by bernie sanders nonetheless it is hillary clinton s turn to win trump and sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice the ambition of sanders to beat hillary clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in although the issues were the same and he could have benefited then from the energy of occupy sander s platform is a reactivation of the occupy themes occupy however is not what it used to be indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked it began as a leaderless anticapitalist movement called us day of rage but soon it acquired leaders like chris hedges and its most radical elements like the black bloc anarchists were vilified and excluded the fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric it must continually borrow one ironically to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it any critical examination will show that the selfproclaimed firebrands of the left have for decades never moved the revolutionary dial an iota if books like noam chomsky s occupy or naomi klein s shock doctrine or chris hedges and joe sacco s days of destruction days of revolt had been genuine they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment because these pseudoradical manifestos have not brought action but paralysisthe latest offering by naomi klein this changes everything will by design change absolutely nothing at all except the balance of her bank account toast of the left author naomi kleinthose few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message twists it and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries don t people know that revolution is never easy and that if it appears to be it is not real if words like earth nature life democracy dissent protest love and revolution are allowed to lose their weight our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct dodo bird it is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaningrevolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a

a new way on false pretenses washington dismantled yugoslavia and serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda in the century this fraud multiplied many times afghanistan iraq somalia and libya were destroyed and iran and syria would also have been destroyed if the president of russia had not prevented it washington is also behind the current destruction of yemen and washington has enabled and financed the israeli destruction of palestine additionally washington operated militarily within pakistan without declaring war murdering many women children and village elders under the guise of combating terrorism washington s war crimes rival those of any country in historyi have documented these crimes in my columns and books clarity press anyone who still believes in the purity of washington s foreign policy is a lost soul russia and china now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for washington russia and china will prevent washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests those countries important to russia and china will be protected by the alliance as the world wakes up and sees the evil that the west represents more countries will seek the protection of russia and chinaamerica is also failing on the economic front my columns and my book the failure of laissez faire capitalism which has been published in english chinese korean czech and german have shown how washington has stood aside indeed cheering it on while the shortterm profit interests of management shareholders and wall street eviscerated the american economy sending manufacturing jobs business knowhow and technology along with professional tradeable skill jobs to china india and other countries leaving america with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years today of yearold americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existancethis brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute us media a source of fantasy stories of america s economic recoverythe facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that i am astonished as a former professor of economics wall street journal editor and assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy i am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector the treasury the financial regulatory agencies and the federal reserve in my day there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officialsin america today there are no free financial markets all the markets are rigged by the federal reserve and the treasury the regulatory agencies controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate turn a blind eye and even if they did not they are helpless to enforce any law because private interests are more powerful than the laweven the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation this lie not only saves washington from paying social security costofliving adjustments and frees the money for more wars but also by understating inflation the government can create real gdp growth by counting inflation as real growth just as the government creates unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up the official unemployment rate is but no one can find a job how can the unemployment rate be when half of olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence as john williams shadowfacts reports the unemployment rate that includes those americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is federal reserve a tool of a small handful of banks has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since june by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s proof of a booming economythe handful of learned people that america has left and it is only a small handful understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us john williams has pointed out that us industrial production when properly adjusted for inflation has never recovered its level much less its peak and has again turned downthe american consumer is exhausted overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth the entire economic policy of america is focused on saving a handful of ny banks not on saving the american economyeconomists and other wall street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as america is now a service economy economists pretend that these are hightech services of the new economy but in fact waitresses bartenders part time retail clerks and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the us on occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems they blame them on chinait is unclear that the us economy can be revived to revive the us economy would require the reregulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and us gdp that offshoring gave to foreign countries it would require as michael hudson demonstrates in his new book killing the host a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sectorthe us government controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and wall street profits today us capitalism makes its money by selling out the american economy and the people dependent upon itin freedom and democracy america the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the american people the sellout of the american people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their livingwhen america fails so will washington s vassal states in europe canada australia and japan unless washington destroys the world in nuclear war the world will be remade and the corrupt and dissolute west will be an insignificant part of the new worlddr paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal he was columnist for business week scripps howard news service and creators syndicate he has had many university appointments his internet columns have attracted a worldwide following roberts latest books are the failure of laissez faire capitalism and economic dissolution of the west how america was

hillary clinton ‚äòisrael first‚äô and no peace for middle east robert fantina counterpunchalthough the united states is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility most polls do not indicate what former secretary of state hillary clinton is most anxious to see a runaway victory for her candidacy it is a good sign that despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the democratic side the coronation she expected isn t going to happenone might say that this writer focuses too much on mrs clinton s adoration of israel but by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation one gets a clear view of some broader very troubling perspectives that mrs clinton seems to holdon january an opinion piece appeared in the jewish journal written by mrs clinton it is a fawning maudlin essay typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the us who knows they must pay homage to their israeli lord and master a few points from this essay tell much about mrs clinton i m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside israel itself brutal stabbings shootings and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent the number of palestinians killed in the west bank alone by settler and iof israel occupation force terrorists is at a tenyear high why is mrs clinton not especially concerned about the continuing wave of violence against palestinians in an area that even the us says israel occupies illegally do not these vicious attacks seek to sow fear among the innocent only a twostate solution negotiated between the parties can provide palestinians independence sovereignty and dignity and provide israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic jewish state why oh why does mrs clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement the borders of the jewish state are recognized by most of the world including the united nations and consist of those determined prior to there is nothing to negotiate does mrs clinton disdain international law it appears that she feels israel like the us in its international dealings is indeed above the law bibi first hillary clinton will never tell israel no and this writer must point out once again that negotiations which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so can only be effective when each side wants something the other has that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has israel wants all of palestine and takes it piece by piece with complete impunity why should palestine agree to pointless negotiationsmrs clinton refers to the secure and recognized borders of a jewish state but does not seem to consider the secure and recognized borders of a palestinian state we must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize israel the boycott divestment and sanctions movement known as bds is the latest front in this battle bds demonizes israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares israel to south african apartheid that s wrong and this campaign should end the most significant efforts to delegitimize israel are made by israel itself its racist society wherein israeli jews have more rights than anyone else in israel its apartheid system of segregation its complete disdain for the human rights of the palestinians the racist murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country and demonize it and rightly so israel is often compared to south african apartheid and the comparison is validand it is not just in the context of palestine and israel that mrs clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance or gross dishonesty her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom we must work with our friends and partners to deny isis territory in the middle east dismantle the global infrastructure of terror and toughen our defenses at home we can t just contain isis we must defeat isis is that really the us s goal garikai chengu a researcher at harvard university suggested in september of that isis is madeintheusa an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oilrich middle east and to counter iran s growing influence in the region in a june column in the guardian associate editor seumas milne said this the us and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups they

mcpain john mccain furious that iran treated us sailors well century wire says as reported earlier this week the unlikely mishap of two us naval vessels straying into iranian waters just hours before the president s state of the union speech followed by the usual parade of archneocons coming on tv in real time to declare the incident as an act of aggression by iran against the united states is no mere hours after the incident the iranians returned all us sailors unharmed and in good spirits the only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in washington known as pretraumatic stress disorder suffered by a certain us senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed daniel mcadams ron paul institute the two us navy riverine command boats intercepted in iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of us sailors after brief detention on iranian soilaccording to news reports the wellarmed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter iranian territory although it may well have been a game of catandmouse to test the iranian response the us sailors were apparently treated well enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the iranians thanks to president obama s policy shift on iran toward engagement and away from isolationism secretary of state john kerry was able to telephone his iranian counterpart mohammad zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situationthis should be a goodnews story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries but sen john mccain raz was having none of it that kerry expressed his appreciation to the iranians for swiftly releasing the american sailors only showed the obama administration s craven desire to preserve the dangerous iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit said mccain in a press releasemccain was furious that obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for iran s graciousness and was outraged that the iranians dared interfere with the actions of us military vessels operating in iranian watersin the world of john mccain only the united states has the right to national sovereignty the us military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a questionaccording to mccain sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention boarding or search their crews are not subject to detention or arrest imagine the tune mccain would have been singing if a wellarmed iranian naval vessel had been spotted in us territorial waters off the coast of new york would he have so rigorously condemned any us interference in the actions of iran s sovereign naval vesselsleave it to some clever twitterers to post an example of the difference between us

whenever there is a dispute or a change of law and two tribes go to war there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation the lawyers ars technicain late yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of email to produce targeted ads the cases which were consolidated in federal court all argued that the privacy rights of nonyahoo users who did not consent to yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails were being violated by a multibillion dollar companynow lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune last week they asked us district judge lucy koh to accept a proposed settlement pdf under the proposal the massive class of nonyahoo users won t get any payment but the class lawyers at girard gibbs and kaplan fox intend to ask for up to million in fees the ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge but yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to millionwhile users won t get any payment yahoo will change how it handles user emails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for yahoo won t stop scanning emails instead the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans emails in the settlement pdf yahoo has agreed that email content will be only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a yahoo mail user can access the email in his

       "44953  sunnistan us and allied ‚äòsafe zone‚äô plan to take territorial booty in northern syria patrick henningsen century wireremember when the obama administration told the world how it hoped to identify reliable nonjihadist moderate rebels hanging out in turkey and jordan who might want to fight for washington in syria after all the drama over its infamous train and equip program to create their own arab army in syria they want to give it another trythis week pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to more moderate fighters but this time the project would take place inside syria and to hell with international lawwe re told that this was requested by ankara and with all nato allies singing the same hymn claiming that this new effort will help in securing turkey s porous border with syria or so the story goes washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular postparis theme to protect civilized europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them as stated in the wall street journal the program would address part of the tense and longrunning dialogue between washington and ankara over sealing the border which western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave syria and travel internationally the timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely isis suicide bomb terrorist attack in turkey of all places where the victims just happened to be german tourists feeding perfectly into europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration shades of gladio undoubtedly but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theoriesour friends at nation builders inc are banking on the global public suffering from syria fatigue but now is the time to really pay attention the west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold despite all of usled coalition s scandals lies epic failures false flags and official conspiracy theories the mainstream narrative on syria persists it s on our tv screens and in our newspapers constantly from los angeles to london from paris to riyadh every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about what to do with syria everyone except the syria people themselves who like the people of iraq libya afghanistan yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests are never afforded any say in their own destiny as is tradition in washington london and paris the only syrian voices which count are the ones who have been handpicked by western technocrats and approved by the saudi royal family to form their everchanging recognized governmentinexile the syrian national council currently that could be riad hijab george sabra or khaled khoja next week it could be three others depending on who has fallen in or out of favor with washington or riyadhto anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict you would have heard determined members of the westernbacked syrian opposition admitting how they would make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power four years later we now see that is exactly what happened but whether you believe that this devil is usled coalition or terrorist armies fighting groups or both might be cause for debate others will argue over which is the bigger devil is it the wahabistsalafist terrorist brigades like al nusra front and islamic state or is it the west and its gcc partnersthe unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive the west and its partners not only created this terror crisis but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand solution to the problemplans azthe terrorist enclave in syria is designed for purpose to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of iraq and syriasince the westernled cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in syria starting with plan a the arab spring method igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for minutes enough to generate some highquality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe inspiring the people on the streets and on twitter to demand change their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the us state department along with its functionaries at human rights watch and amnesty international america and other open society institutefunded ngos and human rights organizations obviously this did not work next plan b the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed paramilitary opposition followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides the us and its allies wasted no time pledging weapons training cash and logistical support to the armed opposition the west set up its own parallel government for syria abroad but it failed to gain any traction with the syria people then came plan c this opposition would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists this fed into an already established war on terror western narrative now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight the washingtonlondonparistelavivriyadhdohaankara axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of bashar al assad in damascus and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos who could blame them after all it worked in libya in late forward to having failed to overthrow assad and implode the nationstate of syria the men and women of nation builders inc and their muscles in brussels nato are quickly moving to plan d take territory that s not to say plans a through d weren t always in the schematics they certainly were and further back than many people would dare to speculatewe now know from wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least but in reality it s probably much earlier than that taking the long view of history and the audacious building and rebuilding of a eurocentric empire in the middle east one could say the process began the day the sykespicot agreement was signed in concealed between those postcolonial lines drawn exactly years ago was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today if those borders are redrawn once again you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago whatever the arrangement it will be to weaken not strengthen the region and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region especially syria proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency with an emphasis on financial and security dependencymice and was one of the first news sources to warn about washington s initial impulse back in when it began calling for a no fly zone in northern syria it was clear that a problem reaction solution dialectic was in play with isis being the object of the public s reaction that plan might have come to fruition in the fall of but a funny thing happened on the way to the un general assembly in new york city later that week russia announced that it would be inserting itself and its air force into the syrian quagmire and with that thwarted any master plan for a usturkey nato controlled no fly zone along the turkishsyrian border suffice to say that russia already knew nato s next move and acted accordingly and with purposewhen asked two days ago about the prospect of the washington dc latest brainchild train and equip this time inside syria here were my initial thoughts we now know why and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on topas any good pirate will tell you if you want to claim your share of the booty you have to do your share of the killing the truth about train and equip the previous train and equip program ended with washington s military brass paraded in front of the senate armed services committee before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of moderate rebels this after being awarded million by the us taxpayer to get er done when originally announced amid much fanfare the public were told that the us government in conjunction with the cia would be arming and training moderate militants in turkey jordan or at a base in saudi arabia before sending them to fight inside syria washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight isis and not the syrian government forces but judging by the unwavering regime change rhetoric from the west it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for isisnine months into the train and equip project us army gen lloyd austin iii acknowledged in sept that they had only managed to get four or five on the battlefield by then not one member of the media challenged this statement probably because most were happy with the answer given one which gave any hawkish critics of the obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for us boots on the ground in syria doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work and that the best solution was to call it quits for the sanguine mainstream media it servedup that alltoo familiar government narrative of a cockup not a coverup this is the media s natural default position in other words well it didn t work out but that s nothing new with our incompetent government nothing to see here move along to ask how the money disappeared or really inquire into how it costs million to train only five men apparently was way too much work for the media not one journalist stopped to ask if only fighters were trained and dispatched then what happened to the half a billion dollarsthe real answer to that question should be selfevident to anyone studying reports on the ground in syria and is way too uncomfortable for the us media to stomach that the us train and equip program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table it wasn t a failure like fall guy gen lloyd austin will have you believe it was a successjudging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al qaeda in syria al nusra front isis jaysh al islam and others it s clear that uncle sam s generous donation of million has definitely been used to equip if not train those rebels in syriamiddle east commentator and analyst sharmine narwani explains the west s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their moderates are in syria for years washington has insisted there are armed moderate groups in syria but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these moderates why because if moderates were named and identified the us would have to be very very certain that no past present or future atrocity video would surface to prove otherwise and the us could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed trained or financed in syria over the past five years the next train and equip round will be more focused and will be used to secure the following the map above is from july but still represents the current military chessboard in syriasafe zone sunnistan somehow it feels like all over again with bad memories of the kla in kosovo imported jihadist fighters in bosnia and nato lording over a newly balkanized regionwhen you hear us officials like john mccain or clueless republican presidential candidates like marco rubio or carly fiorina all crowing for a safe zone in northern syria this is what they are referring to see map above their safe zone just so happens to be in the exact same area where isis is currently holding court it s a safe zone alright but not for refugees and syrians fleeing the evil bashar al assad rather the safe zone will be for an array of rebel and terrorist fighters part of a defacto sunni statelette in waitingso the usled coalition s safe zone is the very caliphate that americans are decryingfor anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in syria they need look no further than a set of us airstrikes that took place before christmas on december us fighter bombers struck a syrian military base located in the village of ayyash in deir ezzor province east of raqqa which killed syrian arab army saa soldiers and wounded additional others naturally the pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place what happened after this incident was extremely telling as explained by global affairs analyst mike whitney from counterpunch magazine it s also worth noting that according to south front military analysis the us bombing raid coincided with a a fullscale isis offensive on the villages of ayyash and bgelia in other words the us attack provided sufficient aircover for isis terrorists to carry out their ground operations was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence so the us air force was coordinating with isis boots on the ground to achieve a common military objective but it didn t end there less than hours after the attack us warplanes bombed the village of alkhan in northeastern syria killing syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women the message the us military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the airspace over east syria where it plans to remove isis and establish a de facto sunni state consistent with its scheme to break syria and iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords islamic fanatics and us puppets also taking place at the same moment on dec was turkey s quiet little invasion into northern iraq sending hundreds of troops and at least tanks into territory north of mosul right between the kurds and isis it should be noted that this illegal incursion by nato member turkey was not approved by the iraqi government in baghdad and iraqi pm haider alabadi called for turkey to immediately withdraw its troops judging by washington s silence on the matter it s obvious that the us gave turkey its full blessing here zero hedge astutely points out the obvious most importantly of all right on what alaraby aljadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal isis crude into turkey from iraq not surprisingly turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that russia began to publicly expose turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the isis oil trade as well as launching airstrikes to destroy isis oil convoys moving from syria into turkey and then turkish leader recep tayyip erdo an photo left places his military assets at the very location where stolen isis oil makes its way from iraq into turkey hardly a coincidencemake no mistake both ends of nato s military axle the united states and turkey along with their saudibacked boots on the ground in isis and al nusra have each made critical strategic moves in unison and with a specific military purpose each time nudging towards securing territory once each key piece is finally in position all that is required is a new crisis either in the region or in europe or in america to allow the axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game whether that s creating a kurdish canton or a sunni statelette such moves will rarely be covered by the western international mediato be perfectly clear the terms sunni and shia are the favored sectarian lexicon used by nation builders inc and its international partners in riyadh and tel aviv my intention here is not to reduce the muslim world down to this paradigm but the architects of instability will use these terms over and over in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized muslims for their own selfish endswhat s the safe zone for as the usled coalition steps up its monthlong punch n judy air operation to supplant isis from raqqa those westernbacked jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their turkish supply lines washington s safe zone would also provide a muchneeded safe haven for rebels who have been sent packing by the syrian government from towns like homs and others as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the assad government and opposition rebels who are willing to participate in the program once the natogcc axis has established a mini protectorate inside of syria this will provide everything isis al nusra ahrar alsham turkmens et all will need a secure launching pad for incursions further inside syria which will certainly guarantee a longer protracted conflict in syria and beyondthis little sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebelterrorist contingent in syria s northwestern idlib governorate province syria s border with turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict so the proposed safe zone will allow turkey to maintain this status quo where it has been continuously allowing the freeflow of weapons rebels and terrorist fighters alike along with oil narcotics and human trafficking to move freely through its southern border with syriaif regime change rhetoric is anything to go by along with turning a blind eye to nato member turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al qaeda and isis then washington s agenda is fairly transparent here if they can establish a internationally recognized safe zone and a nofly zone on top of it central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy damascus install their own western puppet and then carve up syria and northern iraq accordingly isis ratlines black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in syria and iraqfor the architects of instability in washington one crucial benefit of carving out sunni territory in both northern and eastern syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs making it sustainable to guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of syria and into turkey and via kurdistan help is required from the kurdish regional government krg and other stakeholders including the britishturkish firm genel energy just one firm who is providing the endrun to market for illicit isis oil ditto for a key mover and shaker in raqqa s new rockefeller class bilal erdogan the son of turkish president who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oilforterror tradethis is a problem but one which washington london and paris are not overly concerned with much less upset about iraqi kurdish and turkish opposition officials have accused turkish governments and the krg of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take placeeven as provisional statelettes and cantons are conjured around it there is no guarantee that greater kurdistan will ever see the light of day if nation builders inc having anything to say bout it the promise of greater kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists than the reality of a greater kurdistan turkey also has its own interests and ambitions and a greater kurdistan is not compatible with them iraq is not crazy about the idea either because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons so they remain in limb indefinitely even as smaller quasikurdish entities sprout up around the krg turkey has its own ongoing kurdish problem within turkish borders so ankara will naturally view any expressions of kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international kurdish solidarity ruling over the kurds means keeping them divided and playing them off against their neighborsthere are those within the turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled in reclaiming turk territory in both syria and iraqsee also special report isis oil follow the money back to europehere is where sunnistan proper can emerge coming into its own once set pieces are in place in iraq and across kurdistan as mike whitney explained so it looks like an agreement has been struck between turkey the krg and the united states to seize parts of northern iraq and eastern syria to create a de facto sunni state that will be jointlycontrolled by ankara and washington it also looks like obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadiproxies aka terrorists to work alongside us special forces to carry out future military operations so while the effort to remove assad has been temporarily put on the backburner the determination to destroy syria is as strong as ever another dismembered part of old syria and iraq which central planners are hoping to hackoff is an area called rojava see map above or western kurdistan this region in northern syria formerly known as syrian kurdistan gained its autonomy in november as part of the ongoing rojava revolution the kurdish defense forces here are known as the ypg people s defense units and are not on friendly footing with neighboring turkey for a number of reasons not least of all because ypg defense forces present resistance to both al nusra and isis encroachments into all three rojava cantons for turkey this is bad for business how rojava will factor into washington s plans is not clear yet but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboardmake no mistake the history s actors are all in for this plan do not be fooled by talk of peace and stability or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders the un or the fair weather international communityanother indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati and israel too was pnac walrus and former us ambassador to the un john bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity the new york times where he states today s reality is that iraq and syria as we have known them are gone the islamic state has carved out a new entity from the postottoman empire settlement mobilizing sunni opposition to the regime of president bashar alassad and the irandominated government of iraq also emerging after years of effort is a de facto independent kurdistan central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of sunni vs shia sectarian strife in the region which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both saudi arabia and israel bolton confirms this if in this context defeating the islamic state means restoring to power mr assad in syria and iran s puppets in iraq that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable rather than striving to recreate the postworld war i map washington should recognize the new geopolitics the best alternative to the islamic state in northeastern syria and western iraq is a new independent sunni state not so fast mr ambassador the islamic state is the sunni stateso for all intents and purposes he s calling for the establishment of the caliphate funny how this goes right over the heads of conservatives this is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another years as well as provide a timely entr e through to azerbaijan and into iran and later towards the eurasian heartland of dagestan russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbellyin the meantime expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another changing week to week with the usual slogans like we must act now and blaming bashar al assad for the suffering of his people it s already wearing thinuntil the us and its natogcc axis stops flooding syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters and continues its policy of toppling secular nationstates then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one and stand as another exercise in futilityif the syrian conflict has been good for one thing and that s not to say it has it s that the scripted western narrative in all of its variations has finally hit the wall of truthauthor patrick henningsen is

media historyever since the us and its allies began plotting to overthrow libya and syria al jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in into what it has become in a fullblown agit prop media shop for the us state department and the pentagon in fact us military central command centcom for the middle east region is located in qatar s capital of doha conveniently located just down the road from al jazeera s headquarters nice and cozyal jazeera s role in promoting regime change and the destablization of syria is now recorded history as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakerythe qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into north america but no matter how much money they threw at it and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work no one cared about it much less watched it i know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our longterm future the decision that has been made is in no way because ajam has done anything but a great job reads a company email from ceo al anstey obtained by politicoindeed they tried everything it seems just short of paying americans to watch their programs al jazeera america to close down al jazeera america ajam january the qatariowned al jazeera purchased current tv from al gore for an inflated million wait it gets worse money for nothing gore got fat off the ajam dealin addition to the million which doha blew on buying gore s lemon current tv the qataris have spent at least million per year between along with many millions spent on advertising ajam on other network slots online ads along with billboards and print media promotions this was the qataris easy ticket on to us cable and satellite networks boy did gore pull a fast one there in total you would be looking at million for the whole party at its apex ajam would be lucky to pull in viewers during prime time which really amounts to a nothing market sharewith all that money and considering the hundreds of staff and media executives and producers they employed it s safe to say that someones did not have a clue what they were doingwhat a colossal jokeon the bright side the qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda millsread more mainstream media epic fails at century wire

its new year s look ahead we have a new hostage crisis underwaytoday iranian military forces report that two small riverine us navy boats were seized in iranian waters and are currently being held on iran s farsi island in the persian gulf a total of us navy personnel nine men and one woman have been detained by iranian authorities navy strayed us navy patrol boat in the persian gulf image source usniaccording to the pentagon the initial narrative is as follows the sailors were on a training mission around noon et when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into iranianclaimed waters and were detained by the iranian coast guard officials added the story has since been slightly revised by white house spokesman josh earnest to follow this narrativethe boats were traveling en route from kuwait to bahrain when they were stopped and detained by the iraniansaccording to usni search and rescue teams from the harry s truman strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the iranians we have been in contact with iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly pentagon spokesman peter cook told ap according to persian gulf tv farsi island is one of the iranian islands in the persian gulf bushehr province of iran there is an irgc navy base on this island the island has an area of about km and is completely restricted to public due to top secret governmental activities according to nbc news us state department is in touch with tehran officials and the iranians recognize that the us navy straying off course was a mistake and that the sailors will be released within hours war inc cnn s wolf blitzer wasted no time in rampingup talk of military tension with israelifinanced neocon senator tom cottonneocon stuntalready the us media including cnn and fox are running with the talking point that this could not have come at a worse time for president obama right before tonight s state of union speech when he s trying to prove to the american people that iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal this latest naval controversy also comes days before the implementation phase of the iran nuclear deal to say this is a coincidence might be naivethat said could gop and israelaligned members of the pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre minicrisis in order to help weaken usiran relations and by extension obama s controversial iranian nuclear dealthis looks likely to be the case as evidenced by the quick appearance of the israel lobbysponsored prowar us senator tom cotton r placed by cnn to direct aggressive us military talking points live on air as the story broke today cotton photo left immediately called the event hostile and blamed iran for the us boat drifting into iranian waters and then blamed the crisis on president obama who he claims has emboldened the iranian aggression cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie on which his media handler cnn s wolf blitzer does not even blink much less challenge cotton s imaginary statement the iranians who are largely responsible for killing our american soldiers in iraq and afghanistan cotton then went on to threaten iran saying that these sailors and both vessels need to be immediately released if they are not released then the iran nuclear deal should not go forward and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression cotton then proceeded to give a veiled nuclear threat to iran saying that all military options should be on the table would washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this by dispatching the boats off course knowing fullwell that iran would not harm us personnel but using the incident to injure a lame duck the answer is yes and they ve done it before in american diplomats and citizens were held hostage for days in what became known as the iranian hostage crisis which just happened to take place during a us presidential election cycle with then president jimmy carter d running for reelection against challenger ronald reagan r the crisis including a horrific failed rescue attempt was used against carter in the media according to reports at the time reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new iranian regime to holdoff releasing the hostages until after the election in the end reagan won and took credit for that victory not surprisingly at the end of his prearranged cnn segment cotton invoked the feckless foreign policy of jimmy carter which caused the iran hostage crisis and compared that to president obama s current policyof all the us officials cnn could have brought in on short notice they chose senator tom cotton the most hawkish and closest aligned to israel clearly this looks like a neocon

       "      <td>#Hashtag Hell &amp; The Fake Left  By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

       "      <td>Astroturfing: Journalist Reveals Brainwashing Tactic Uses to Manipulate Public Opinion Vic Bishop Waking TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

       "      <td>The New American Century: An Era of Fraud Paul Craig RobertsIn the last years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.

destroyed if the president of russia had not prevented it washington is also behind the current destruction of yemen and washington has enabled and financed the israeli destruction of palestine additionally washington operated militarily within pakistan without declaring war murdering many women children and village elders under the guise of combating terrorism washington s war crimes rival those of any country in historyi have documented these crimes in my columns and books clarity press anyone who still believes in the purity of washington s foreign policy is a lost soul russia and china now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for washington russia and china will prevent washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests those countries important to russia and china will be protected by the alliance as the world wakes up and sees the evil that the west represents more countries will seek the protection of russia and chinaamerica is also failing on the economic front my columns and my book the failure of laissez faire capitalism which has been published in english chinese korean czech and german have shown how washington has stood aside indeed cheering it on while the shortterm profit interests of management shareholders and wall street eviscerated the american economy sending manufacturing jobs business knowhow and technology along with professional tradeable skill jobs to china india and other countries leaving america with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years today of yearold americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existancethis brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute us media a source of fantasy stories of america s economic recoverythe facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that i am astonished as a former professor of economics wall street journal editor and assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy i am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector the treasury the financial regulatory agencies and the federal reserve in my day there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officialsin america today there are no free financial markets all the markets are rigged by the federal reserve and the treasury the regulatory agencies controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate turn a blind eye and even if they did not they are helpless to enforce any law because private interests are more powerful than the laweven the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation this lie not only saves washington from paying social security costofliving adjustments and frees the money for more wars but also by understating inflation the government can create real gdp growth by counting inflation as real growth just as the government creates unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up the official unemployment rate is but no one can find a job how can the unemployment rate be when half of olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence as john williams shadowfacts reports the unemployment rate that includes those americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is federal reserve a tool of a small handful of banks has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since june by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s proof of a booming economythe handful of learned people that america has left and it is only a small handful understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us john williams has pointed out that us industrial production when properly adjusted for inflation has never recovered its level much less its peak and has again turned downthe american consumer is exhausted overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth the entire economic policy of america is focused on saving a handful of ny banks not on saving the american economyeconomists and other wall street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as america is now a service economy economists pretend that these are hightech services of the new economy but in fact waitresses bartenders part time retail clerks and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the us on occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems they blame them on chinait is unclear that the us economy can be revived to revive the us economy would require the reregulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and us gdp that offshoring gave to foreign countries it would require as michael hudson demonstrates in his new book killing the host a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and

       "      <td>Hillary Clinton: ‚ÄòIsrael First‚Äô (and no peace for Middle East) Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

       "      <td>McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well 21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

       "      <td>JUSTICE? Yahoo Settles E-mail Privacy Class-action: $4M for Lawyers, $0 for Users 21st Century Wire says It s a familiar theme. Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013, Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users, who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week, they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal, the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment, Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF), Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox. The settlement deal looks pretty similar to what Yahoo had argued it did in the first place Continue this story at Ars TechnicaREAD MORE NSA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NSA Files</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sunnistan: US and Allied ‚ÄòSafe Zone‚Äô Plan to Take Territorial Booty in Northern Syria Patrick Henningsen  21st Century WireRemember when the Obama Administration told the world how it hoped to identify 5,000 reliable non-jihadist  moderate  rebels hanging out in Turkey and Jordan, who might want to fight for Washington in Syria? After all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own Arab army in Syria, they want to give it another try.This week, Pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside Syria (and to hell with international law).We re told that this was requested by Ankara, and with all NATO allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing Turkey s porous border with Syria, or so the story goes. Washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-Paris theme: to protect civilized Europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the Wall Street Journal: The program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between Washington and Ankara over sealing the border, which Western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave Syria and travel internationally, The timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely ISIS  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in Turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 German tourists, feeding perfectly into Europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. Shades of GLADIO, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).Our friends at Nation Builders Inc are banking on the global public suffering from Syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. The west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold Despite all of US-led Coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on Syria persists. It s on our TV screens and in our newspapers constantly   from Los Angeles to London, from Paris to Riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with Syria?  Everyone, except the Syria people  themselves, who like the people of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. As is tradition in Washington, London and Paris, the only Syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the Saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the Syrian National Council. Currently, that could be Riad Hijab,  George Sabra or Khaled Khoja. Next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with Washington or Riyadh.To anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  Syrian Opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  Four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is US-led Coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. Others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the Wahabist-Salafist terrorist brigades like al Nusra Front and Islamic State, or is it the West and its GCC partners?The unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. The West and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.Plans A-ZThe terrorist enclave in Syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of Iraq and Syria.Since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in Syria, starting with Plan A: the Arab Spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on Twitter) to demand  change . Their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the US State Department, along with its functionaries at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International America, and other Open Society Institute-funded NGOs and  human rights  organizations. Obviously, this did not work. Next, Plan B: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. The US and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. The west set up its own parallel government for Syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the Syria people. Then came Plan C: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. This fed into an already established  War on Terror  western narrative. Now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. The Washington-London-Paris-Tel-Aviv-Riyadh-Doha-Ankara Axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of Bashar al Assad in Damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. Who could blame them? After all, it worked in Libya in late 2011.Fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow Assad and implode the nation-state of Syria, the men and women of Nation Builders Inc and their muscles in Brussels (NATO), are quickly moving to Plan D: take territory. That s not to say plans A through D weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.We now know from Wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. Taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a Euro-centric empire in the Middle East, one could say the process began the day the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed in 1916. Concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. If those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. Whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially Syria. Proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.Mice and Men21WIRE was one of the first news sources to warn about Washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  No Fly Zone  in Northern Syria. It was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with ISIS being the object of the public s reaction. That plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the UN General Assembly in New York City. Later that week, Russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its Air Force, into the Syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a US-Turkey (NATO) controlled No Fly Zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. Suffice to say, that Russia already knew NATO s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.When asked two days ago about the prospect of the Washington DC latest brainchild, Train and Equip 2.0, this time inside Syria, here were my initial thoughts: We now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.As any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. The Truth About  Train and Equip The previous  train and equip  program ended with Washington s military brass paraded in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the US taxpayer to get er done. When originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the US government, in conjunction with the CIA, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in Turkey, Jordan or at a base in Saudi Arabia   before sending them to fight inside Syria. Washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight ISIS, and not the Syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for ISIS.Nine months into the train and equip project, US Army Gen. Lloyd Austin III, acknowledged in Sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. Not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the Obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for US  boots on the ground  in Syria. Doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. For the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  This is the media s natural default position. In other words,  Well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. Nothing to see here, move along.  To ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. Not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?The real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in Syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the US media to stomach   that the US  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. It wasn t a failure like fall guy Gen. Lloyd Austin will have you believe, it was a success.Judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al Qaeda in Syria (al Nusra Front), ISIS, Jaysh al Islam and others   it s clear that Uncle Sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in Syria.Middle East commentator and analyst Sharmine Narwani explains the West s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in Syria: For years, Washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in Syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  Why? Because if moderates were named and identified, the US would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. And the US could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in Syria over the past five years. The next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  The map above is from July 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in Syria.Safe Zone =  Sunnistan Somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the KLA in Kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in Bosnia, and NATO lording over a newly balkanized region.When you hear US officials like John McCain or clueless Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina, all crowing for a  Safe Zone  in northern Syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). Their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where ISIS is currently holding court. It s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  Syrians fleeing the evil Bashar al Assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto Sunni state-lette in waiting.So the US-led Coalition s  safe zone  is the very Caliphate that Americans are decrying.For anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in Syria, they need look no further than a set of US airstrikes that took place before Christmas. On December 6, 2015,  US fighter bombers struck a Syrian military base located in the village of Ayyash in Deir Ezzor Province, east of Raqqa, which killed 3 Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldiers and wounded additional others. Naturally, the Pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. What happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst Mike Whitney from Counterpunch Magazine: It s also worth noting, that according to South Front military analysis, the US bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale ISIS offensive on the villages of Ayyash and Bgelia.  In other words, the US attack provided sufficient air-cover for ISIS terrorists to carry out their ground operations. Was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? So the US air force was coordinating with ISIS boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. But it didn t end there. Less than 24 hours after the attack, US warplanes bombed the village of Al-Khan in north-eastern Syria killing 26 Syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. The message the US military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east Syria where it plans to remove ISIS and establish a de facto Sunni state consistent with its scheme to break Syria and Iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, Islamic fanatics, and US puppets. Also taking place at the same moment on Dec 6th, was Turkey s quiet little invasion into northern Iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of Mosul, right between the Kurds and ISIS. It should be noted that this illegal incursion by NATO member Turkey was not approved by the Iraqi government in Baghdad, and Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi called for Turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  Judging by Washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the US gave Turkey its full blessing. Here, Zero Hedge astutely points out the obvious: Most importantly of all, right on what Al-Araby al-Jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal ISIS crude into Turkey from Iraq.  Not surprisingly, Turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that Russia began to publicly expose Turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the ISIS oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy ISIS oil convoys moving from Syria into Turkey. And then Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen ISIS oil makes its way from Iraq into Turkey? Hardly a coincidence.Make no mistake, both ends of NATO s military axle, the United States and Turkey, along with their Saudi-backed boots on the ground in ISIS and al Nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. Once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in Europe, or in America   to allow the Axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a Kurdish canton, or a Sunni state-lette. Such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.To be perfectly clear, the terms  Sunni  and  Shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by Nation Builders Inc and its international partners in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. My intention here is not to reduce the Muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized Muslims for their own selfish ends.What s the  safe zone  for? As the US-led Coalition steps up its 18 month-long Punch  n Judy air operation to supplant ISIS from Raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their Turkish supply lines. Washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the Syrian government from towns like Homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the Assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. Once the NATO-GCC Axis has established a mini protectorate inside of Syria, this will provide everything ISIS, al Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside Syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in Syria   and beyond.This little Sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in Syria s northwestern Idlib governorate (province). Syria s border with Turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow Turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with Syria.If  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to NATO member Turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al Qaeda and ISIS, then Washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. If they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a No-Fly Zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy Damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up Syria and northern Iraq accordingly. ISIS RAT-LINES: Black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in Syria, and Iraq.For the architects of instability in Washington, one crucial benefit of carving out Sunni territory in both northern and eastern Syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. To guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of Syria and into Turkey and via Kurdistan, help is required from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and other stakeholders, including the British-Turkish firm Genel Energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit ISIS oil. Ditto for a key mover and shaker in Raqqa s new Rockefeller class, Bilal Erdogan, the son of Turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.This is a problem, but one which Washington, London and Paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. Iraqi, Kurdish and Turkish opposition officials have accused Turkish governments and the KRG of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.Even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that Greater Kurdistan will ever see the light of day if Nation Builders Inc having anything to say bout it. The promise of Greater Kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a Greater Kurdistan. Turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a Greater Kurdistan is not compatible with them. Iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. So they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-Kurdish entities sprout up around the KRG. Turkey has its own ongoing  Kurdish problem  within Turkish borders, so Ankara will naturally view any expressions of Kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international Kurdish solidarity. Ruling over the Kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.There are those within the Turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming Turk territory in both Syria and Iraq.SEE ALSO: SPECIAL REPORT: ISIS Oil? Follow the Money (Back to Europe)Here is where Sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in Iraq and across Kurdistan, as Mike Whitney explained: So it looks like an agreement has been struck between Turkey, the KRG and the United States to seize parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria to create a de facto Sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by Ankara and Washington.  It also looks like Obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka Terrorists) to work alongside US Special Forces to carry out future military operations.  So while the effort to remove Assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy Syria is as strong as ever.  Another dismembered part of old Syria and Iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called Rojava (see map above), or  Western Kurdistan . This region in northern Syria, formerly known as Syrian Kurdistan, gained its autonomy in November 2013 as part of the ongoing Rojava Revolution. The Kurdish defense forces here are known as the YPG (People s Defense Units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring Turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because YPG defense forces present resistance to both al Nusra and ISIS encroachments into all three Rojava cantons. For Turkey, this is bad for business. How Rojava will factor into Washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.Make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. Do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the UN, or the fair weather international community.Another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and Israel too, was PNAC walrus and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the New York Times, where he states: Today s reality is that Iraq and Syria as we have known them are gone. The Islamic State has carved out a new entity from the post-Ottoman Empire settlement, mobilizing Sunni opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-dominated government of Iraq. Also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent Kurdistan. Central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of Sunni vs Shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Bolton confirms this: If, in this context, defeating the Islamic State means restoring to power Mr. Assad in Syria and Iran s puppets in Iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state. Not so fast Mr. Ambassador. The Islamic State is the Sunni State.So for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the Caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). This is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to Azerbaijan and into Iran, and later towards the Eurasian heartland of Dagestan (Russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).In the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming Bashar al Assad for the suffering of his people. It s already wearing thin.Until the US and its NATO-GCC Axis stops flooding Syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.If the Syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***Author Patrick Henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international TV and radio.

reasons so they remain in limb indefinitely even as smaller quasikurdish entities sprout up around the krg turkey has its own ongoing kurdish problem within turkish borders so ankara will naturally view any expressions of kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international kurdish solidarity ruling over the kurds means keeping them divided and playing them off against their neighborsthere are those within the turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled in reclaiming turk territory in both syria and iraqsee also special report isis oil follow the money back to europehere is where sunnistan proper can emerge coming into its own once set pieces are in place in iraq and across kurdistan as mike whitney explained so it looks like an agreement has been struck between turkey the krg and the united states to seize parts of northern iraq and eastern syria to create a de facto sunni state that will be jointlycontrolled by ankara and washington it also looks like obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadiproxies aka terrorists to work alongside us special forces to carry out future military operations so while the effort to remove assad has been temporarily put on the backburner the determination to destroy syria is as strong as ever another dismembered part of old syria and iraq which central planners are hoping to hackoff is an area called rojava see map above or western kurdistan this region in northern syria formerly known as syrian kurdistan gained its autonomy in november as part of the ongoing rojava revolution the kurdish defense forces here are known as the ypg people s defense units and are not on friendly footing with neighboring turkey for a number of reasons not least of all because ypg defense forces present resistance to both al nusra and isis encroachments into all three rojava cantons for turkey this is bad for business how rojava will factor into washington s plans is not clear yet but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboardmake no mistake the history s actors are all in for this plan do not be fooled by talk of peace and stability or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders the un or the fair weather international communityanother indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati and israel too was pnac walrus and former us ambassador to the un john bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity the new york times where he states today s reality is that iraq and syria as we have known them are gone the islamic state has carved out a new entity from the postottoman empire settlement mobilizing sunni opposition to the regime of president bashar alassad and the irandominated government of iraq also emerging after years of effort is a de facto independent kurdistan central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of sunni vs shia sectarian strife in the region which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both saudi arabia and israel bolton confirms this if in this context defeating the islamic state means restoring to power mr assad in syria and iran s puppets in iraq that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable rather than striving to recreate the postworld war i map washington should recognize the new geopolitics the best alternative to the islamic state in northeastern syria and western iraq is a new independent sunni state not so fast mr ambassador the islamic state is the sunni stateso for all intents and purposes he s calling for the establishment of the caliphate funny how this goes right over the heads of conservatives this is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another years as well as provide a timely entr e through to azerbaijan and into iran and later towards the eurasian heartland of dagestan russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbellyin the meantime expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another changing week to week with the usual slogans like we must act now and blaming bashar al assad for the suffering of his people it s already wearing thinuntil the us and its natogcc axis stops flooding syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters and continues its policy of toppling secular nationstates then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one and stand as another exercise in futilityif the syrian conflict has been good for one thing and that s not to say it has it s that the scripted western narrative in all of its variations has finally hit the wall of truthauthor patrick henningsen is

       "      <td>How to Blow $700 Million: Al Jazeera America Finally Calls it Quits 21st Century Wire says Al Jazeera America will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in broadcast media history.Ever since the US and its allies began plotting to overthrow Libya and Syria, Al Jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in 2003   into what it has become in 2016   a full-blown agit prop media shop for the US State Department and the Pentagon. In fact, US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha, conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it. I know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job,  reads a company email from CEO Al Anstey, obtained by Politico.Indeed, they tried everything it seems, just short of paying Americans to watch their programs Al Jazeera America to close down https://t.co/EmFjBw9uC1 pic.twitter.com/HDea8ujTPt  Al Jazeera America (@ajam) January 13, 2016In 2012, the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera purchased Current TV from Al Gore for an inflated $500 million. Wait, it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon, Current TV, the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy, did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex, AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side, the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch</td>\n",

       "      <td>10 U.S. Navy Sailors Held by Iranian Military ‚Äì Signs of a Neocon Political Stunt 21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.Today, Iranian military forces report that two small riverine U.S. Navy boats were seized in Iranian waters, and are currently being held on Iran s Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. A total of 10 U.S. Navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by Iranian authorities. NAVY STRAYED: U.S. Navy patrol boat in the Persian Gulf (Image Source: USNI)According to the Pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: The sailors were on a training mission around noon ET when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into Iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the Iranian Coast Guard, officials added. The story has since been slightly revised by White House spokesman Josh Earnest to follow this narrative:The 2 boats were traveling en route from Kuwait to Bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the Iranians.According to USNI, search and rescue teams from the Harry S. Truman Strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the Iranians. We have been in contact with Iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told AP. According to Persian Gulf TV: Farsi Island is one of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, Bushehr province of Iran. There is an IRGC Navy base on this Island. The island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. According to NBC News, U.S. State Department is in touch with Tehran officials and the Iranians recognize that the U.S. Navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  WAR INC: CNN s Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with Israeli-financed neocon Senator Tom Cotton.Neocon StuntAlready, the U.S. media, including CNN and FOX, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for President Obama right before tonight s State Of Union speech, when he s trying to prove to the American people that Iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. This latest Naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the Iran Nuclear Deal. To say this is a coincidence might be naive.That said, could GOP and Israel-aligned members of the Pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken U.S.-Iran relations, and by extension, Obama s controversial Iranian Nuclear Deal?This looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the Israel Lobby-sponsored, pro-war U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R), placed by CNN to direct aggressive U.S. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. Cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed Iran for the U.S. boat drifting into Iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on President Obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the Iranian aggression. Cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, CNN s Wolf Blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge Cotton s imaginary statement: The Iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (American) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cotton then went on to threaten Iran, saying that: These sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. If they are not released, then the Iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  Cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to Iran, saying that,  All (military) options should be on the table.  Would Washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that Iran would not harm U.S. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? The answer is  yes , and they ve done it before In 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which just happened to take place during a US presidential election cycle, with then president Jimmy Carter (D) running for reelection against challenger Ronald Reagan (R). The crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against Carter in the media. According to reports at the time Reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new Iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. In the end, Reagan won and took credit for that  victory .Not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged CNN segment, Cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of Jimmy Carter which  caused  the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, and compared that to President Obama s current policy.Of all the U.S. Officials CNN could have brought in on  short notice , they chose Senator Tom Cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to Israel. Clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.Stay tuned for more updates.READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran Files</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                                                     Obama knocks Trump, voices optimism  WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

as well as antiestablishment conservatives who favor cruz the debate on the fox business network is due to begin at pm et on thursday gmt on friday the son of cuban immigrants rubio has drawn support by stressing his workingclass upbringing in las vegas and miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier but voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate facetoface politicking considered mandatory by voters in either iowa or new hampshire which has a feb primary rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks ‚äúi feel good but we‚äôve got to close strong‚äù said rubio‚äôs new hampshire state director jim merrill a reutersipsos opinion poll showed rubio on wednesday at percent compared to percent little more than a month ago falling from second place to fifth among republicans after trump cruz bush and retired neurosurgeon ben carson some voters have cited a tendency by rubio in past months to stick to wellhoned talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at townhall meetings where people can ask questions this has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience ‚äúthere‚äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be but in iowa it just seems like he hasn‚äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚äôs causing some pause‚äù iowa republican strategist doug gross said dennis thorell of new durham new hampshire said rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than us senator and former speaker of the florida house of representatives thorell said rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a republican administration ‚äúhe hasn‚äôt had any experience running anything‚äù thorell said while listening to rubio in concord new hampshire last week ‚äúhe did very well in the legislature down in florida and was mentored by jeb bush but he hasn‚äôt run anything‚äù rival candidates for the republican nomination have assailed rubio also for his absences from the us senate during hearings and floor votes raising further questions about how he spends his time defending his record of missed votes rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his senate committee work both of which he says continue unabated rubio aides told reuters they plan a multimilliondollar advertising campaign for new hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the tv airwaves in the state the aides said rubio has plans to be a major presence in both iowa and new hampshire in the final stretch with a schedule that will include plenty of giveandtake with voters in informal settings such as town halls they said rubio‚äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals but that much of it has been at behindthescenes fundraising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push republican strategists say rubio‚äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a thirdplace finish in iowa presumably behind poll leaders cruz and trump which would deliver him some momentum going into new hampshire if rubio goes on to place high in iowa and do well in new hampshire he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race ‚äúfrom the getgo we said we didn‚äôt want to peak in september we wanted to peak in february it‚äôs starting to grow it feels like it‚äôs starting to happen for us‚äù rubio spokesman alex conant said republican analysts say rubio appears to be as wellplaced as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment republican favorite he is drawing increasingly larger crowds in new hampshire and has a solid organization in the state ‚äúi think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors‚äù republican strategist steve duprey said ‚äúif he puts the pedal to the metal he could do very well‚äù for more on the presidential race see the reuters blog ‚äútales from

pains to rebuke trump the real estate billionaire whose redhot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the nov presidential election obama and haley although from different parties offered a defense of establishment politics a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground obama seemed to refer specifically to trump‚äôs call for a temporary ban on muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in san bernardino california by a couple authorities said had been radicalized ‚äúwe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion this isn‚äôt a matter of political correctness‚äù obama said trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of america losing ground both economically and in terms of global influence obama rejected that idea outright ‚äúit‚äôs easier to be cynical‚äù obama said ‚äúto accept that change isn‚äôt possible and politics is hopeless and to believe that our voices and actions don‚äôt matter‚äù soon after obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the house of representatives trump tweeted ‚äúthe state of the union speech was one of the most boring rambling and nonsubstantive i have heard in a long time‚äù while consistently criticizing obama‚äôs record haley the daughter of indian immigrants and a potential republican vice presidential choice also seemed to indict trump‚äôs message ‚äúsome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference‚äù she said ‚äúthat is just not true often the best thing we can do is turn down the volume when the sound is quieter you can actually hear what someone else is saying and that can make a world of difference‚äù like obama haley did not mention trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on nbc‚äôs ‚äútoday show‚äù on wednesday while calling on the republican party to be more inclusive ‚äúmr trump has definitely contributed to what i think is just irresponsible talk‚äù she said trump responded shortly afterward by telling fox news that haley has been ‚äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚äù for a long time paul sracic chairman of the politics department at youngstown state university in ohio said trump was dominating ‚äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago‚äù ‚äúdonald trump must be smiling tonight‚äù he said pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the state of the union address but also the republican response the white house gave haley credit for defending ‚äúamerican values‚äù in her speech ‚äúshe was willing to do something that a lot of other republicans leading republicans have been unwilling to do‚äù white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters on wednesday but he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of haley‚äôs positions obama flew on wednesday to nebraska a republican ‚äúred state‚äù to promote the bigpicture ideas he laid out in his speech on tuesday night obama also appeared to single out conservative texas senator ted cruz the top challenger to trump in the republican race cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in iraq and syria to wipe out islamic state forces meeting the threat of islamic state obama said ‚äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians‚äù

on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in american history‚äù both trump and cruz who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in iowa and new hampshire have pledged to push the republican party in a more confrontational direction and seek to undo much of what obama has accomplished as president both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the obama administration on its approach to islamic state obama‚äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state hillary clinton who is trying to stave off a challenge from selfdescribed democratic socialist bernie sanders in the democratic presidential contest said bannon ‚äúhe‚äôs taking about holding up the establishment‚äù he said ‚äúwhen the president makes a good case it helps hillary more than bernie‚äù but john geer an expert on voter opinion at vanderbilt university thought obama in his bid for unity damaged clinton‚äôs prospects by not making

       "      <td>In Republican state, Obama talks with worried American mom OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. to expand refugee program for Central Americans fleeing violence WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bid to mine more coal on U.S. federal lands tests Obama's green agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S. CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cheesy puns abound as White House hosts online chat (Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.

Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck.

       "      <td>New York's Cuomo proposes $145.3 billion budget, caps spending ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump looms behind both Obama and Haley speeches  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

parties offered a defense of establishment politics a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground obama seemed to refer specifically to trump‚äôs call for a temporary ban on muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in san bernardino california by a couple authorities said had been radicalized ‚äúwe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion this isn‚äôt a matter of political correctness‚äù obama said trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of america losing ground both economically and in terms of global influence obama rejected that idea outright ‚äúit‚äôs easier to be cynical‚äù obama said ‚äúto accept that change isn‚äôt possible and politics is hopeless and to believe that our voices and actions don‚äôt matter‚äù soon after obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the house of representatives trump tweeted ‚äúthe state of the union speech was one of the most boring rambling and nonsubstantive i have heard in a long time‚äù while consistently criticizing obama‚äôs record haley the daughter of indian immigrants and a potential republican vice presidential choice also seemed to indict trump‚äôs message ‚äúsome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference‚äù she said ‚äúthat is just not true often the best thing we can do is turn down the volume when the sound is quieter you can actually hear what someone else is saying and that can make a world of difference‚äù like obama haley did not mention trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on nbc‚äôs ‚äútoday show‚äù on wednesday while calling on the republican party to be more inclusive ‚äúmr trump has definitely contributed to what i think is just irresponsible talk‚äù she said trump responded shortly afterward by telling fox news that haley has been ‚äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚äù for a long time paul sracic chairman of the politics department at youngstown state university in ohio said trump was dominating ‚äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago‚äù ‚äúdonald trump must be smiling tonight‚äù he said pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the state of the union address but also the republican response the white house gave haley credit for defending ‚äúamerican values‚äù in her speech ‚äúshe was willing to do something that a lot of other republicans leading republicans have been unwilling to do‚äù white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters on wednesday but he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of haley‚äôs positions obama flew on wednesday to nebraska a republican ‚äúred state‚äù to promote the bigpicture ideas he laid out in his speech on tuesday night obama also appeared to single out conservative texas senator ted cruz the top challenger to trump in the republican race cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in iraq and syria to wipe out islamic state forces meeting the threat of islamic state obama said ‚äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians‚äù democratic strategist brad bannon said obama ‚äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone‚äù cruz quickly countered in a statement obama he said ‚äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in american history‚äù both trump and cruz who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in iowa and new hampshire have pledged to push the republican party in a more confrontational direction and seek to undo much of what obama has accomplished as president both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the obama administration on its approach to islamic state obama‚äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state hillary clinton who is trying to stave off a challenge from selfdescribed democratic socialist bernie sanders in the democratic presidential contest said bannon ‚äúhe‚äôs taking about holding up the establishment‚äù he said ‚äúwhen the president makes a good case it helps hillary more than bernie‚äù but john geer an expert on voter opinion at vanderbilt university thought obama in his bid for unity damaged clinton‚äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for continuing the democratic agenda ‚äúhe didn‚äôt put forward an argument why there should be another democrat for four years‚äù geer said ‚äúi think she would have liked to see that‚äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>House of Representatives to try again to seek Iran deal clampdown WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Obama knocks Trump, voices optimism  WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",
