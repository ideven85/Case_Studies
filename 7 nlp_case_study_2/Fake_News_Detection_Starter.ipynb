    "The objective of this assignment is to develop a Semantic Classification model. You will be using Word2Vec method to extract the semantic relations from the text and develop a basic understanding of how to train supervised models to categorise text based on its meaning, rather than just syntax. You will explore how this technique is used in situations where understanding textual meaning plays a critical role in making accurate and efficient decisions.\n"

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬† Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.  ¬†¬†¬† Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.     \n",

Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants.

       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.</td>\n",

With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.   \n",

Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot   \n",

Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons   \n",

Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.   \n",

The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter   \n",

I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia   \n",

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times   \n",

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov   \n",
       "8  On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook   \n",

Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube   \n",

       "      <td>It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this. And, as much as we d like to disprove it, we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter.Featured image via Flickr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons</td>\n",

       "      <td>During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s. Featured image via video screen grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Garret Wayman, a 17-year-old waiter in Wichita, Kansas, tweeted photos of a $20 dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral. The reason? The $20-dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist Christian, that was only disguised as a $20-dollar bill.someone seriously left this as my tip today. pissed is an understatement. i was so excited when i saw $20 pic.twitter.com/czntdlgoqS  garret (@BEANBURRlTO) December 29, 2015The note, once opened, reads,  Don t be fooled! There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed. But all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia</td>\n",

       "      <td>A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015</td>\n",
       "      <td>A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)</td>\n",
       "      <td>On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ // &lt; ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&amp;gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video</td>\n",
       "      <td>After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for \"total Muslim ban\" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban &amp; Awlaki predicting bigotry &amp; \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube</td>\n",

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù ‚Äú#BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it,‚Äù wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). ‚ÄúPure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay,‚Äù tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: ‚ÄúI think you have to be a ‚ÄúWest Wing‚Äù fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today.‚Äù Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: ‚ÄúAmericans shouldn‚Äôt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬† Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.  ¬†¬†¬† Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.     \n",

Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.             \n",

Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù        \n",

Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.    \n",
       "9                                                                                 WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are at the top of the Republican field, while self-described ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is giving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tough competition in early voting states for the Democratic primary contest.     \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.</td>\n",
       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù TV series. Following President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: ‚ÄúSeeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate.

       "      <td>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state‚Äôs history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York‚Äôs capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state‚Äôs finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday‚Äôs speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThis nation has real problems that we haven‚Äôt seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,‚Äù Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo‚Äôs infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was not in the room during U.S. President Barack Obama‚Äôs final State of the Union speech, but the Republican presidential front-runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  Both Obama‚Äôs speech on Tuesday and, for that matter, the Republican response by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, took pains to rebuke Trump, the real estate billionaire whose red-hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama and Haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. Obama seemed to refer specifically to Trump‚Äôs call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in San Bernardino, California, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. ‚ÄúWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn‚Äôt a matter of political correctness,‚Äù Obama said. Trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of America losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. Obama rejected that idea outright.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be cynical,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúto accept that change isn‚Äôt possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Soon after Obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThe State of the Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.‚Äù While consistently criticizing Obama‚Äôs record, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and a potential Republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict Trump‚Äôs message. ‚ÄúSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.‚Äù Like Obama, Haley did not mention Trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday show‚Äù on Wednesday while calling on the Republican Party to be more inclusive. ‚ÄúMr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,‚Äù she said. Trump responded shortly afterward by telling Fox News that Haley has been ‚Äúvery weak on illegal immigration‚Äù for a long time. Paul Sracic, chairman of the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said Trump was dominating ‚Äúour political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúDonald Trump must be smiling tonight,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the State of the Union address, but also the Republican response. The White House gave Haley credit for defending ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù in her speech. ‚ÄúShe was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans - leading Republicans - have been unwilling to do,‚Äù White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.  But he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of Haley‚Äôs positions. Obama flew on Wednesday to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù to promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  On Tuesday night, Obama also appeared to single out conservative Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the top challenger to Trump in the Republican race. Cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria to wipe out Islamic State forces. Meeting the threat of Islamic State, Obama said, ‚Äúneeds to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Obama ‚Äúmade the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.‚Äù  Cruz quickly countered in a statement. Obama, he said, ‚Äúlectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in American history.‚Äù Both Trump and Cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, have pledged to push the Republican Party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what Obama has accomplished as president. Both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the Obama administration on its approach to Islamic State.     Obama‚Äôs defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest, said Bannon.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking about holding up the establishment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the president makes a good case, it helps Hillary more than Bernie.‚Äù But John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, thought Obama, in his bid for unity, damaged Clinton‚Äôs prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the Democratic agenda. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt put forward an argument why there should be another Democrat for four years,‚Äù Geer said. ‚ÄúI think she would have liked to see that.‚Äù</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The House‚Äôs Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. ‚ÄúIran has been on a bit of a tear,‚Äù said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. ‚ÄúIf Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards?‚Äù Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led House‚Äôs more than 60 votes to repeal Obama‚Äôs healthcare law. ‚ÄúWe should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law,‚Äù said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the ‚ÄúIran Terror Finance Transparency Act,‚Äù saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obama‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama took aim on Tuesday at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and accused critics of playing into the hands of Islamic State in a speech meant to cement his legacy and set a positive tone for his final year in office. Obama, delivering his last annual State of the Union speech to Congress as president, called for leaders to ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics and criticized candidates such as Trump for using anti-Muslim rhetoric that betrayed American values. ‚ÄúWhen politicians insult Muslims ... that doesn‚Äôt make us safer,‚Äù he said, drawing applause from the crowd in the House of Representatives chamber. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.‚Äù Trump, whom Obama did not mention by name in his speech, is leading the Republican field ahead of the Nov. 8 election to pick the next president. The billionaire businessman, citing national security concerns, has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, ideas the White House strongly opposes. Obama sought to contrast his more optimistic view of America‚Äôs future with those of the Republican candidates trying to replace him.  He said it was ‚Äúfiction‚Äù to describe the country as being in economic decline. While acknowledging that al Qaeda and Islamic State posed a direct threat to Americans, he said comparing the effort to defeat the militants who control swaths of Iraq and Syria to World War Three gave the group just what it wanted. ‚ÄúMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages: they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,‚Äù Obama said. Republicans say the president‚Äôs strategy to defeat Islamic State is flawed and insufficient. ‚ÄúHis policies aren‚Äôt working. He didn‚Äôt have an answer for how to defeat ISIS,‚Äù Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement after the speech, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Obama‚Äôs address to lawmakers, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices was one of his last remaining chances to capture the attention of millions of Americans before the November election. The next president will take office in January 2017. Trump, in a posting on Twitter, called the speech ‚Äúboring‚Äù and lacking in substance. ‚ÄúNew leadership fast!‚Äù But South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who delivered the Republican response to Obama‚Äôs address, took her own jab at Trump and other less moderate candidates in her party. ‚ÄúDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,‚Äù said Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants.     ‚ÄúNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,‚Äù she said. Obama‚Äôs address came as 10 sailors aboard two U.S. Navy boats were taken into Iranian custody. Iran told the United States the crew members would be ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù returned, U.S. officials said. The event gave Republicans further fodder to criticize Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal with Tehran. Obama did not address the issue in his speech. The White House expects the situation to be resolved quickly. Obama, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, stuck to themes he hopes will define his legacy, including last year‚Äôs nuclear pact with Tehran. He noted areas where compromise was possible with Republicans in Congress including criminal justice reform, trade and poverty reduction. He called for lawmakers to ratify a Pacific trade pact, advance tighter gun laws and lift an embargo on Cuba. The president also said he regretted not having been able to elevate U.S. political discourse during his time in office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,‚Äù he said. To help ‚Äúfix‚Äù U.S. politics, Obama pressed for an end to ‚Äúgerrymandering,‚Äù the practice of drawing voting districts in ways that gives advantage to a particular party; reducing the influence of ‚Äúdark money‚Äù or political spending in which funding sources do not have to be disclosed; and making voting easier. Obama also said he had tasked Vice President Joe Biden, whose son died last year of cancer, to lead an effort to find a cure for the disease. The president noted some outstanding promises from his own 2008 campaign. He pledged to continue to work to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to lift the embargo on the Communist-ruled island nation. Obama, whose 2008 victory was driven partially by his opposition to the Iraq war, said the United States could not serve as policeman of the world. ‚ÄúWe also can‚Äôt try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it‚Äôs done with the best of intentions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lesson of Vietnam; it‚Äôs the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by now.‚Äù Obama is eager for a Democrat to win the White House to preserve his legacy, but anger over his policies and fears about security threats have helped push non-traditional candidates to the fore in the Republican and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic races to succeed him.

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.    \n",
       "1  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.    \n",

The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.    \n",

Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.    \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions.

Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt had any experience running anything,‚Äù Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. ‚ÄúHe did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn‚Äôt run anything.‚Äù Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio‚Äôs schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio‚Äôs path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. ‚ÄúFrom the get-go we said we didn‚Äôt want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It‚Äôs starting to grow. It feels like it‚Äôs starting to happen for us,‚Äù Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. ‚ÄúI think he suffered from the perception that he hasn‚Äôt been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,‚Äù Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. ‚ÄúIf he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.‚Äù For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, ‚ÄúTales from the Trail‚Äù (here).    \n",

       "      <td>OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country‚Äôs polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican ‚Äúred state,‚Äù is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her ‚Äúoverwhelming sense of dread‚Äù about climate change. ‚ÄúWill he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?‚Äù Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. ‚ÄúCall it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,‚Äù Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got ‚Äúwhupped‚Äù in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by ‚Äúa bunch of folks right across the river‚Äù - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party‚Äôs nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just hot air. That‚Äôs bluster. That‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another word for it that starts with a ‚Äòb‚Äô - it‚Äôs baloney,‚Äù he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama‚Äôs push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>South Korea calls for 'bone-numbing' sanctions on North for nuclear test</td>\n",
       "      <td>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea warned North Korea on Wednesday that the United States and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict ‚Äúbone-numbing pain‚Äù after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  With tension high on the border after the North‚Äôs fourth nuclear test on Wednesday last week, South Korean forces fired shots toward what Yonhap News Agency said was a suspected North Korean drone.  It returned to the North after the shots, South Korean military officials told Reuters. The North‚Äôs nuclear test angered both China and the United States and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. The World Economic Forum withdrew its invitation for North Korea‚Äôs foreign minister to attend its annual Davos meeting because of the nuclear test. It was to have been the country‚Äôs first participation in the event in 18 years. The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the North. But apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, urging the ‚Äúdetonation of more powerful H-bombs‚Äù, the North‚Äôs state media reported. North Korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the United States and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said more ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù by the North including ‚Äúcyber-terrorism‚Äù were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. She did not give specifics. ‚ÄúWe are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,‚Äù she said in a speech. Park said South Korea and China were discussing a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, noting that China had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. China is North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while Beijing‚Äôs ties with South Korea have grown closer in recent years. ‚ÄúI am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn‚Äôt followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North‚Äôs fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI believe the Chinese government will not allow the situation on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate further.‚Äù Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday and said the three agreed that a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù new sanctions resolution was needed from the Security Council. ‚ÄúI hope the Chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. We will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,‚Äù he said. In Washington, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said China could and should put more pressure on North Korea. ‚ÄúWe understand their concern about instability on the Korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,‚Äù he told a news briefing. Rhodes said it was important the United States and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to Sunday‚Äôs U.S. B-52 bomber flight over South Korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both South Korea and Japan. Rhodes also said that President Barack Obama chose not to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he did not want to give Kim Jong Un the attention. ‚ÄúHe likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the State of the Union,‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.‚Äù China rejects complaints it is not doing enough on North Korea. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China‚Äôs efforts toward a denuclearised Korean peninsula would continue. ‚ÄúThis is in everyone‚Äôs interests and is everyone‚Äôs responsibility, including China and South Korea,‚Äù he said. The U.S. House sanctions measure passed by 418-2 and Senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. The House bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after North Korea‚Äôs latest test. ‚Äú(The bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate Kim Jong Un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,‚Äù said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an author of the measure. To become law, it must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by Obama. The 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the North. South Korea, still technically at war with the North since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. South Korea‚Äôs military said it had found anti-South leaflets in the Seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from North Korean hot air balloons. South Korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by North Korea, although none has been detected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. The announcement follows backlash from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who called on the Obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime-infested Central American countries and entered the United States without documentation. The expanded Refugee Admissions Program would offer ‚Äúa safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,‚Äù Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. President Barack Obama previously said the United States would take in 3,000 refugees from Latin America by October this year. A State Department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number ‚Äúshould conditions require.‚Äù He said the U.S. government would work with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. He specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. ‚ÄúWe also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,‚Äù Kerry said. Once the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights refers a potential refugee to the United States for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a Resettlement Support Center, according to the State Department.    The United States operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the Western hemisphere - in Quito, Ecuador. The State Department spokesperson said the Quito center operates a branch office in San Salvador, El Salvador.  Kerry did not say whether the United States would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  The Department of Homeland Security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in Central America, some of whom have begun to arrive in the United States as refugees, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said on Jan. 4. He said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama‚Äôs State of the Union pledge to better manage fossil fuel development will face a test within days, when federal officials rule on whether to open public lands containing more than 600 million tons of coal to more mining. Interior Department officials are due to decide Jan. 27 on whether to lease two mine sites on federal land in Wyoming‚Äôs coal-rich Powder River Basin, where the black rock runs in 10-story seams. Environmentalists strongly oppose more coal mining on federal land, saying burning all that coal would exacerbate climate change. Reforming government controls on federal lands is one of the few actions still available to Obama in his final year in office.  Developing the two Wyoming sites would make more than 640 million tons of coal available to mining companies, according to the Interior Department. Each ton of burned coal creates 1.66 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to government data. That means burning all the coal at the lease sites would add more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land, and environmentalists have argued strongly against permitting more mining there.  The Interior Department must assess the environmental impact of each energy lease under a law enacted during the 1970s under President Richard Nixon, decades before climate change became a concern to policymakers. Conservationists say those  environmental studies should account for the wider climate impact. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama vowed to ‚Äúchange the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.‚Äù In Obama‚Äôs first term, the Interior Department mulled but  balked at raising royalty rates on companies that tap federal land. Since then, environmentalists have urged the White House to undertake a sweeping review of fossil fuel extraction. In the meantime, they have called on the administration to refrain from awarding further leases, including the two in Wyoming. ‚ÄúUntil the administration steps back and considers all the impacts, we need a moratorium,‚Äù said Jeremy Nichols of WildEarth Guardians which joined several other conservation groups in a letter on Wednesday urging Obama to freeze coal leases. The two leases under consideration are West Antelope III and Decker South, which abut existing mines. The administration has not indicated its position on those two leases, and the Interior Department on Wednesday declined to comment. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited western states last summer, calling for ‚Äúan honest and open conversation about modernizing the federal government‚Äôs coal program.‚Äù Last year, Obama used his authority to help secure a global climate agreement between nearly 200 countries. He also denied a permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline and issued new rules to crack down on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. In coming weeks, the Interior department‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management is also expected to release a plan to curb emissions from oil and gas production on federal land. ‚ÄúThis is the obvious low-hanging fruit on climate change that he hasn‚Äôt touched yet,‚Äù said a Congressional aide who tracks the administration‚Äôs coal policies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party‚Äôs 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa‚Äôs Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI feel good but we‚Äôve got to close strong,‚Äù said Rubio‚Äôs New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that‚Äôs causing some pause,‚Äù Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.
