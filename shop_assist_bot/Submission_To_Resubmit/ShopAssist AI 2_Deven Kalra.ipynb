    "\n",
    "In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed **ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements*.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation and Information Gathering**: The chatbot will utilize language models to understand and generate natural responses. Through a conversational flow, it will ask relevant questions to gather information about the user's requirements.\n",
    "2. **Information Extraction**: Once the essential information is collected, rule-based functions come into play, extracting top 3 laptops that best matches the user's needs.\n",
    "3. **Personalized Recommendation**: Leveraging this extracted information, the chatbot engages in further dialogue with the user, efficiently addressing their queries and aiding them in finding the perfect laptop solution."
