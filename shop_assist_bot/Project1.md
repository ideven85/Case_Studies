**Option 1: Build Your Own Project (BYOP)**  
In the "Build Your Own Project" option, you can conceive, design, and implement your own AI-driven project. This is an exciting opportunity to explore your passion for AI and create a chatbot that can impact any domain you choose. Here are some project ideas to spark your imagination:  
* **Travel Planner AI: **Develop a chatbot that assists travellers in planning their trips. It can recommend top hotels and suggest itineraries based on user-specified destinations.  
* **Restaurant Recommender AI:** Create a chatbot that helps users find the perfect restaurant for any occasion. It can consider factors like cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, location, and user reviews to make tailored recommendations.  
As you work on your custom project, remember to document your progress meticulously. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines your project's goals, the AI model used, data sources, key design decisions, and any challenges you encountered.  
 *NOTE: Remember, you can source data for your project from publicly available datasets from platforms like Kaggle or even collect data yourself. The key is choosing a project that aligns with your interests and objectives and has a meaningful application in the real world.*  
**Option 2: Enhance ShopAssist AI (ShopAssist 2.0)**  
If you prefer a structured project with a clear starting point, you can enhance ShopAssist AI, taking it to the next level as ShopAssist 2.0. In this option, you will leverage the newly introduced 'function calling' feature to create a more streamlined and efficient chatbot. Here are the tasks involved:  
* **Integrate Function Calling API:** Modify the existing architecture to leverage the Function Calling API's capabilities for improved performance. Scope out which layers can be removed and how the existing layers can be updated to handle the new approach.  
* **Refine Conversation Flow: **Enhance the chatbot's conversation flow by leveraging function calling. Make the interaction between the user and the chatbot more natural and dynamic.  
* **Document and Present:** Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the changes made, the integration process, and the benefits of using the Function Calling API. Prepare a presentation to showcase the enhancements.  
Both options offer exciting opportunities to apply your AI skills and creativity. Whether you build your own project or enhance ShopAssist AI, you'll gain valuable experience in conversational AI and contribute to the development of innovative AI solutions.  
In the next segment, you will learn about the Function Calling API and understand how it can transform your chatbot into more efficient, adaptable and user-centric.  
  
  
Now that you are familiar with different project options and function calling API, in the next session, you will understand the evaluation criteria and submission for this project.  
 As we delve into the next phase of your AI journey, it's crucial to outline the evaluation criteria that will guide the assessment of your projects. Whether you build your own project (BYOP) or enhance ShopAssist AI (ShopAssist 2.0), these criteria provide a fair and comprehensive assessment framework for your endeavours.
